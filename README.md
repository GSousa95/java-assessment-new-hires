# Autograding Example: Java
This example project is written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### The assignment
This assignment is composed by 3 problems. Each problem has each own class and the description is there.
The unit tests are already setup to expect the correct output and they'll run as github actions as soon as you push your changes and merge them to master.

### Setup command
N/A

### Run command
`gradle test`

### Notes
- The JDK is installed on GitHub Actions machines, so you're also able to directly invoke `javac`, `java`, or any other CLI command included in the JDK.

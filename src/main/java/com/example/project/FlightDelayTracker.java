/**
 * Problem 2
 * Design a flight delay tracking system that records delays for various reasons such as
 * technical issues, air traffic congestion, weather, etc.
 * Implement methods to add a delay for a flight, check if a flight is delayed,
 * and get the total delay time for a flight, considering the different delay categories.
 *
 * TIP: every flight must be represented by a flight number which is usually a string eg. EK1723

/**
 * Problem 1
 * Design a flight booking system where users can book flights based on availability.
 * Implement methods for booking a flight, checking seat availability, and to cancel a booking.
 * Additionally, introduce seat allocation logic to optimize seat usage,
 * considering factors like seat preferences and booking for more than one passenger.
 *
 * TIP: every flight must be represented by a flight number which is usually a string eg. EK1723
